## 1: Discord Server

First, you have to make a discord server. In the server you have to make a channel with a webhook (There are many tuts on youtube). Put the webhook url into the script.

## 2: Blob creation

Second, you have to create a blob. To do this you use the zipper script, and put your source file with your webhook into it.

## 3: Final script

Copy the blob from before and put it into the stealer script. once you have done this you have a functional python file. If you want to get an exe use [pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) (pyinstaller Stealer.py --onefile)

## Note

Not very efective for inproper use; It gets detected by antivirus easily.
